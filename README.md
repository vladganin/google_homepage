This is the project I have been working on - to create a Google-like search front page. I will try to use Git throughout my work. The text editor of choice for me at the current moment is Visual Studio Code with Atom Dark theme. The operating system is Linux (Ubuntu distribution with some fancy stuff on it to make it look better, of course).
Hello Odin Project!

Update. I finished the project. It took me roughly 2 hours of work. I had to consult web only once: I had problem with the searchbox - difficult to amke the box shadows for it. It was nice using Git for the first time and I think the homepage looks nice.
A screenshot showing the project is attached as well. Cheers!
