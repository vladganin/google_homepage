This is the project I have been working on - to create a Google-like search front page. I will try to use Git throughout my work. The text editor of choice for me at the current moment is Visual Studio Code with Atom Dark theme. The operating system is Linux (Ubuntu distribution with some fancy stuff on it to make it look better, of course).
Hello Odin Project!
